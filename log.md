# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 20, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Set up installations, completed the odin-recipes project using basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** Since I have prior experience with HTML, this project was pretty simple for me, but I wanted to start from the ground up to build a solid foundational understanding.

### Day 1: Sept 21, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Did a couple of basic CSS exercises online.

**Thoughts:** I never properly learned CSS before, so these easy exercises helped me gain a good base understanding so I don't have to use AI for everything.

### Day 2: Sept 22, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started a new personal project - building a workout app.

**Thoughts:** This is my first project that might actually be useful, I built the basic framework, and I plan to add more functionalities tomorrow.

### Day 3: Sept 23, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the workout app. Implemented python back-end CRUD functions.

### Day 4: Sept 24, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the workout app. Implemented user accounts and authentication.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool that I actually used something I learned from high school. Now I need to implement an actual database that persists.

### Day 5: Sept 25, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the workout app. Connected to AWS RDS database.

### Day 6: Sept 26, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the workout app. Deployed it to streamlit. Now fully functional.

**Thoughts:** I guess this marks the completion of my first project, although I'd like to continue developing it and adding more features. Right now it's a pretty bare-bones app, but it works.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Odin CSS foundational exercises.

### Day 9: Sept 29, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Introduced myself to Figma, started revamping the UI for my workout app.

**Thoughts:** It feels nice actually making decent-looking front-end stuff, but so far I'm just experimenting. I hope to finish the design soon and learn how to integrate it with my app.
