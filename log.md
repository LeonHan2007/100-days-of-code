# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 20, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Set up installations, completed the odin-recipes project using basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** Since I have prior experience with HTML, this project was pretty simple for me, but I wanted to start from the ground up to build a solid foundational understanding.
